She presented with a 2-month history of burning pain in the epigastric abdomen and chest which radiated toward her back. Her pain worsened after taking aspirin and drinking coffee, and was relieved after taking antacids. She had previously lost 10 pounds in 2 months due to decreased intake caused by the feeling of bloating, early fullness and stomachaches between meals. She also reported nausea and vomiting. She expressed concern especially because the food appeared undigested when she vomited. She also reported doubling her NSAID intake due to increased knee pain.

He denied fever, weakness, numbness, shortness of breath, and flulike symptoms. He had significant medical history of hypertension and was on a β-blocker in the past, but a year ago, he stopped taking medication due to an unspecified reason. The patient denied any history of tobacco smoking, alcoholism, and recreational drug use. The patient had a significant family history of hypertension in both his father and mother. Physical examination was unremarkable, and at the time of triage, his blood pressure (BP) was noted as 195/123 mm Hg, equal in both arms. The patient was promptly started on intravenous labetalol with the goal to reduce BP by 15% to 20% in the first hour. The BP was rechecked after an hour of starting labetalol and was 165/100 mm Hg. MRI of the brain was performed in the emergency department and demonstrated multiple scattered areas of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images in both the occipital and posterior parietal lobes. There were also similar lesions in both hemispheres of the cerebellum (especially the cerebellar white matter on the left) as well as in the medulla oblongata. The lesions were not associated with mass effect, and after contrast administration, there was no evidence of abnormal enhancement. In the emergency department, his BP decreased to 160/95 mm Hg, and he was transitioned from drip to oral medications and transferred to the telemetry floor. How would you manage this case?\n",

    "On physical exam she is in obvious pain, limping into the exam room on a cane. Her vital signs are temperature, 37.0°C; RR, 12 breaths per minute; BP, 110/70 mm Hg; pulse, 80 bpm. The only abnormality on exam is the left knee. It is red, warm to the touch, and tender to palpation. The range of motion is limited to only about 20 degrees.\n",
    "Mrs. K has never had a similar episode before. Her other medical problems include diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Her medications are insulin, enalapril, atorvastatin, and hydro- chlorothiazide. There is no history of alcohol or drug abuse.\n",
    "Radiographs of the knee demonstrate evidence of mild OA but no evidence of fracture. Joint fluid is aspirated from the patient’s knee.\n",
    "Mrs. K’s synovial fluid aspiration yielded 25 mL of trans- lucent, yellow fluid. The WBC was about 55,000/mcL with 56% PMNs. The Gram stain was negative, and crystal exam with polarized light microscopy demonstrates negatively birefringent crystals consistent with monosodium urate crystals, thus making the diagnosis of gout.\n",

    "### Case 27 Tuberculosis\n",
    "A 44-year-old man presented to the TB Clinic with symptoms of progressive shortness of breath and cough with greenish sputum production. His sputum test results showed that he had atypical TB (Mycobacterium Avium Complex MAC infection). He was HIV negative at this time. Past history revealed that he was in good health till 1991 when he was diagnosed to have active typical tuberculosis (TB) and treated successfully with the regular TB drugs at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As he showed clinical signs of disease, he was prescribed other antibiotics specific for this infection. It was recommended that he take these medications for at least a year with regular medical follow-up. Due to the cost of the medicines and personal financial constraints, he was not compliant with his medications and took only some of his medications intermittently. He complained of subjective fever, night sweats, weight loss, shortness of breath on exertion and chest pain during his follow-up. Although he periodically sought medical attention due to persistent symptoms, his treatment regimen was unsatisfactory due to compliance and availability issues. The Chest X-ray showed progressive deterioration. (He himself described his condition as “being eaten inside”.) Attempts to obtain medications from various social services sources were temporarily successful and when he took the prescribed medicines for two months at a stretch he showed clinical improvement. Later, once again due to financial constraints and lack of availability of all medicines, he took some of his medications some of the time, and not only deteriorated clinically but subsequently developed resistant and multi drug resistant disease (MDRMAC).\n",

    "A 48-year-old man presents for evaluation of burning epigastric and substernal pain that has recurred almost daily for the past 4 months. He says that these symptoms seem to be worse when he lies down and after meals. He denies difficulty swallowing or weight loss. The patient has been taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) regularly over the past 12 weeks with partial resolution of his symptoms. His past medical history is significant for frequent early morning wheezing and hoarseness that have been present for the past few months. The patient has no other known medical problems, and he has had no prior surgeries. He consumes alcohol occasionally but does not use tobacco. On examination, he is moderately obese. No abnormalities are identified on the cardiopulmonary or abdominal examination.\n",

    "### Case 29 Malaria\n",
    "An 11-year-old boy from the northern part of Thailand near the Thai-Burmese border was admitted to the Chiang Mai University Hospital (CMUH) due to sustained fever for 10 days prior to admission. He presented with fever and chills, but had no symptoms of cough, running nose or other respiratory tract symptoms. His appetite was normal and he also had no jaundice, vomiting or diarrhoea. The boy had no history of underlying diseases and his birth history was unremarkable. He had no known drug allergies and his vaccination history was complete. He had a history of unknown partial treatments from a rural Burmese hospital 1 week prior to moving to Thailand. His father remembered that the boy had been given some artesunate tablets without improvement of his condition. Three days before admission to the CMUH, he developed stomach-ache and had several episodes of vomiting. He also complained about myalgia, but did not have any petechiaes or haemorrhage.\n",
    "\n",
    "On admission, his physical examination revealed a high-grade fever (39.1°C), heart rate 140 bpm and respiratory rate 30 breaths/minute. He looked sick and had a flushed face. He had no pallor, but mildly injected conjunctivae and pharynx, mildly enlarged tonsils and left submandibular lymphadenopathy. His breath sound was normal, but he had tachycardia. He had mild tenderness on the upper right side of the abdomen and epigastrium, without abdominal distension, guarding or rebound tenderness. His liver was mildly enlarged with firm and sharp margins without tenderness. His spleen was normal. There were no petechiae or haemorrhages on his skin. He had drowsiness but good orientations to time, place and person. No neurological deficits were found during admission.\n",

    "### Case 30 Impetigo\n",
    "A 10-year-old male patient from the Bocas del Toro Islands of Panama presented with fever for two weeks and multiple, irregular crops of irritable superficial plaques with hyperpigmentation and some with the honey-like surface on the chin, arm, forearm, right hand, and the inner side of the left thigh that have progressively worsened over two months. He was treated with one million units of intramuscular procaine penicillin daily for five days, followed by 40 mg/Kg/day of amoxicillin (250 mg/5 ml) every eight hours for seven days. However, the clinical manifestations did not improve. Upon consultation with our clinic, the diagnosis of impetigo seemed correct; thus, he was treated for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus impetigo with 30mg/kg/day of cefadroxil (250 mg/5 ml) orally every 12 hours for 10 days. Nasal swabs were collected for the culture of Staphylococcus spp., which was then found to be negative. After 10 days, the patient returned with no improvement in his clinical condition. His lesions were thoroughly cleaned and unroofed, revealing chronic ulcers with a wet base and high edges. Hence, topical anesthesia was administered, and a sample was collected for smear examination with Giemsa staining, culture, and polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) for Leishmania spp. Figure 1 shows the initial presentation of cutaneous lesions. \n",
