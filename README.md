# A-Chatbot-for-medical-diagnosis
This project involves the use of NLP and Machine learning to develop a chatbot to diagnose patients with certain symptoms.

All jupyter notebooks related to testing and evaluating the various components of the chatbot are in the Evaluation and tesing folder

The main code files for the chatbot are in the medbot folder

To run the chatbot download the medbot folder to your local machine

Next downoad the fasttext mdeol from this link https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-english/crawl-300d-2M-subword.zip

Extract the .bin file and put it in the data folder which is in the chatbot folder

Run the run.py file

It will take about 40 to 50 seconds to run initially as the fasttext model is large and take time to load
